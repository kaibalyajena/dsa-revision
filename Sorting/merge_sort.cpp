//MERGE SORT (DIVIDE AND CONQUER)

//ALGORITHM
// divide the array into equal part and merge the 2 sorted parts

//1. In order to implement merge sort we need to first divide the given array into two halves. Now, if we carefully observe, we need not divide the array and create a separate array, but we will divide the arrayâ€™s range into halves every time. For example, the given range of the array is 0 to 4(0-based indexing). Now on the first go, we will divide the range into half like (0+4)/2 = 2. So, the range of the left half will be 0 to 2 and for the right half, the range will be 3 to 4. Similarly, if the given range is low to high, the range for the two halves will be low to mid and mid+1 to high, where mid = (low+high)/2. This process will continue until the range size becomes.
//2. So, in mergeSort(), we will divide the array around the middle index(rather than creating a separate array) by making the recursive call :
//    1. mergeSort(arr,low,mid)   [Left half of the array]
//    2. mergeSort(arr,mid+1,high)  [Right half of the array]
//    where low = leftmost index of the array, high = rightmost index of the array, and mid = middle index of the array.
//3. Now, in order to complete the recursive function, we need to write the base case as well. We know from step 2.1, that our recursion ends when the array has only 1 element left. So, the leftmost index, low, and the rightmost index high become the same as they are pointing to a single element.
// Base Case: if(low >= high) return;


void merge(vector<int> &arr,int low,int mid,int high){
    vector<int> temp;
    int left=low;
    int right=mid+1;
    while(left<=mid && right<=high){
        if(arr[left]>=arr[right]){
            temp.push_back(arr[left]);
            left++;
        }else{
            temp.push_back(arr[right]);
            right++;
        }
    }
    while(left<=mid){
        temp.push_back(arr[left]);
        left++;
    }
    while(right<=high){
        temp.push_back(arr[right]);
        right++;
    }
    for(int i=low;i<=high;i++){
        arr[i]=temp[i-low];
    }
}


void mergeSort(vector<int> &arr,int low,int high){
    if(low>=high){
        return;
    }
    int mid=low+(high-low)/2;
    mergeSort(arr,low,mid);
    mergerSort(arr,mid+1,high);
    merge(arr,low,mid,high);
